## Type class Derivation in Scala 3 

This repo shows how to derive type class instances in Scala 3. There are two approaches here. One of them uses the [Scala 3 framework](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/contextual/derivation.html), and the other uses [Shapeless 3](https://github.com/typelevel/shapeless-3). Both approaches take the `Show` type class as an example.

This is the companion repository of the [How to derive type class instances with Shapeless 3](https://xebia.com/blog/how-to-derive-type-class-instances-with-shapeless-3/) blog post.
